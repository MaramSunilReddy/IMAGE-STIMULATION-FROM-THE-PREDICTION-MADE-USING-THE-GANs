# IMAGE-STIMULATION-FROM-THE-PREDICTION-MADE-USING-THE-GANs
	In this proposed system we can modify the image horizontally and vertically as per our   need.
	We can improve the quality of the image using this system.
	From this we can stimulate the image and can make it looking more attractive then the captured image
 
	Despite the challenges involved in its implementation, image stimulation has many novel and exciting applications. 
	we can use image stimulation for panorama creation, vertically-filmed video expansion, and texture creation
